Hello from djltaga

I am human! Are you? Then read further.

I am in my estimation an amateur programmer. I know a bit of c++, java, php, sql, html and css but not a master of any.  I am interested in mastering java which may branch into android but also desire to learn more on php, sql, html, css and do some learning also on javascript and others.
That's it for now humans.

djltaga =P
